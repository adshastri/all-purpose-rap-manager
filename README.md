# All-Purpose Rap Playlist Manager

This is a manager for the playlist "All-Purpose Rap" on Spotify owned by Aneesh Deshpande. The intention was to curate it to only have well-liked songs but making it collaborative meant that anyone could add to it. This allows anyone to request a song for addition or removal, and a majority of the admins have to agree to the proposal.
